        <h1>Animal Kingdom</h1>
        All animals belong to a biological kingdom called kingdom Animalia. This
        kingdom is then broken down into over 30 groups, or phyla (plural form
        of phylum). About 75% of all species on Earth are animals. Animals are

      <article><p>No matter your age, there’s nothing cooler than seeing an exotic animal in its natural habitat. That first time you see a lion hunting alongside its pride or a whale gliding through the ocean, you can’t help but be giddy with childlike excitement. </p>
        <p>Your heart beats a little faster and your eyes grow a little wider as the creatures of storybooks and movies come alive right in front of you. If you share our love for wildlife, you know exactly what we’re talking about. Below read about 45 animals around the world and where to see them.</p>

AFRICA
When you hear Africa, you can’t help but think of the exotic wildlife and safari experience. A trip to this incredible continent should be on every bucket list, whether you love animals, love culture, or love cuisine – it has it all!</article>

    The “king of the jungle” is on everyone’s must-see list. Simba and his family live in the grasslands and savannahs of sub-Saharan Africa. Head to Tanzania, Kenya, Botswana, or South Africa to see these majestic creatures.
<p>As the largest land animal on the earth, an elephant won’t be hard to miss! African elephants grow to about 13 feet tall and weigh thousands of pounds. Both male and female African elephants have tusks, and they use them to dig for food. They live in the same area as lions – sub-Saharan Africa.

Cheetahs are the fastest mammals on the earth, and can go from 0-60mph in 3 seconds, putting Speedy Gonzalez to shame. It is incredible to see one moving full speed! Cheetahs can be found in sub-Saharan Africa and Iran.</div>

<p>There are two types of rhinos found in Africa: black rhino and white rhino. 
    The former can be found in South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya;
     the latter is found mainly in South Africa but also Botswana, Namibia,
      Swaziland, and Zimbabwe.</p>
      <p> Rhinos are a prime poaching target and are critically 
      endangered as a result. The Rhinos Without Borders project is relocating rhinos
       from South Africa to Botswana
     (this country has strict anti-poaching laws) as an effort to conserve the species.</p>
