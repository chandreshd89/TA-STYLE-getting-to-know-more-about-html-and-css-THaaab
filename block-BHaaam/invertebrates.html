      Animals without a backbone are invertebrates. Most invertebrates are in
      the phylum Arthropoda. Invertebrates serve as food for humans; are key
      elements in food chains that support birds, fish, and many other
      vertebrate species; and play important roles in plant pollination. Despite
      providing important environmental services, invertebrates are often
      ancillary in wildlife research and conservation, with priority given
      instead to studies that focus on large vertebrates. In addition, several
      invertebrate groups (including many types of insects and worms) are viewed
      solely as pests, and by the early 21st century the heavy use of pesticides
      worldwide had caused substantial population declines among bees, wasps,
      and other terrestrial insects.

     <p class="text"> Horseshoe worm, phylum name Phoronida, a small group (about 12 species) of
      wormlike marine invertebrates that live in tubes secreted by special
      glands. These protective tubes become encrusted with shells or are buried
      in sand. Horseshoe worms, or phoronids, either are solitary or occur in
      groups of many thousands of individuals; one species is colonial and buds
      asexually. The body of the horseshoe worm is elongated and measures from
      15 to 200 mm (0.6 to 8 inches) in length. It has a U-shaped gut and nerve,
      excretory, and reproductive organs. Feeding is by means of a protrusible
      lophophore, a structure at the anterior end that bears a circle or paired
      spiral of as many as 1,500 ciliated tentacles. The cilia produce a water
      current, and the tentacles trap food particles beneath a flap (epistome)
      that covers the central mouth. Groups of lophophores are often grazed on
      by fish but are then regenerated.
     Some phoronid species have separate
      sexes, but others are hermaphroditic (i.e., both male and female organs
      occur in the same individual).
      >All have free-swimming ciliated larvae.</p><br>
      Although most horseshoe worms are found intertidally or in shallow ocean
      regions in temperate zones, their habitats also include tropical regions
      and ocean depths. In general, horseshoe worms are uncommon; individuals of
      certain species, however, may carpet the bottoms of shallow bays.
      Horseshoe worms are of little practical value to man, but their unusual
      life cycle and obscure ancestry have made them objects of biological
      interest. Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to

      worms have been associated with every animal phylum, yet the relationship
      of horseshoe worms to other animals remains controversial. They have not
      been preserved as fossils in the geological record, although fossil tubes
      (called Scolithus) may belong to horseshoe worms. Embryological stages
      often are useful in relating animal groups, but the actinotroch larva of
      horseshoe worms is unique.       </p><br>
    <h3>characteristics of invertebrate</h3>
    <article><p>
      The trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a
      vertebral column (backbone): this creates a distinction between
      invertebrates and vertebrates. The distinction is one of convenience only;
      it is not based on any clear biologically homologous trait, any more than
      the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and
      birds, or than not having wings unites tortoises, snails and sponges.
      Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in
      the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions,
      such as the Porifera, invertebrates generally have bodies composed of
      differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with
      one or two openings to the exterior.

      The body plans of most multicellular organisms exhibit some form of
      symmetry, whether radial, bilateral, or spherical. A minority, however,
      exhibit no symmetry. One example of asymmetric invertebrates includes all
      gastropod species.This is easily seen in snails and sea snails, which
      have helical shells. Slugs appear externally symmetrical, but their
      pneumostome (breathing hole) is located on the right side. Other
      gastropods develop external asymmetry, such as Glaucus atlanticus that
      develops asymmetrical cerata as they mature. </p></article><br>
      <article><p>The origin of gastropod
      asymmetry is a subject of scientific debate.[12] Other examples of
      asymmetry are found in fiddler crabs and hermit crabs. They often have one
      claw much larger than the other. If a male fiddler loses its large claw,
      it will grow another on the opposite side after moulting.</p><br>
      <p> Sessile animals
      such as sponges are asymmetrical[13] alongside coral colonies (with the
      exception of the individual polyps that exhibit radial symmetry);
      alpheidae claws that lack pincers; and some copepods,
      polyopisthocotyleans, and monogeneans which parasitize by attachment or
      residency within the gill chamber of their fish hosts).
