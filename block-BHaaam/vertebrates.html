      Animals with a backbone are vertebrates. Vertebrates belong to the phylum
      called Phylum Chordata. Vertebrates are further broken down into five
      classes: amphibians, birds, fish, mammals, and reptiles. Animals without a
      backbone are invertebrates. Most invertebrates are in the phylum
      Arthropoda.

      Although the vertebral column is perhaps the most obvious vertebrate
      feature, it was not present in the first vertebrates, which probably had
      only a notochord. The vertebrate has a distinct head, with a
      differentiated tubular brain and three pairs of sense organs (nasal,
      optic, and otic). The body is divided into trunk and tail regions. The
      presence of pharyngeal slits with gills indicates a relatively high
      metabolic rate. A well-developed notochord enclosed in perichordal
      connective tissue, with a tubular spinal cord in a connective tissue canal
      above it, is flanked by a number of segmented muscle masses. A sensory
      ganglion develops on the dorsal root of the spinal nerve, and segmental
      autonomic ganglia grow below the notochord. The trunk region is filled
      with a large, bilateral body cavity (coelom) with contained viscera, and
      this coelom extends anteriorly into the visceral arches. A digestive
      system consists of an esophagus extending from the pharynx to the stomach
      and a gut from the stomach to the anus. A distinct heart, anteroventral to
      the liver, is enclosed in a pericardial sac. A basic pattern of closed
      circulatory vessels is largely preserved in most living forms. Unique,
      bilateral kidneys lie retroperitoneally (dorsal to the main body cavity)
      and serve blood maintenance and excretory functions. Reproductive organs
      are formed from tissue adjacent to the kidneys; this original close
      association is attested by the tubular connections seen in males of living
      forms. The ducts of the excretory organs open through the body wall into a
      cloacal chamber, as does the anus of the digestive tract. Reproductive
      cells are shed through nearby abdominal pores or through special ducts. A
      muscular tail continues the axial musculature of the trunk. Approximately
      45,000 living species constitute the vertebrates. Species of several
      classes are found from the high Arctic or Antarctic to the tropics around
      the Earth; they are missing only from interior Antarctica and Greenland
      and from the North Polar ice pack.</article></section>

      <section><article>In size, vertebrates range from minute
      fishes to elephants and whales (of up to 100 tons), the largest animals
      ever to have existed. Vertebrates are adapted to life underground, on the
      surface, and in the air. They feed upon plants, invertebrate animals, and
      one another. Vertebrate faunas are important to humans for food and
      recreation. Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to

      subdivided here into major groups based on morphology: the cyclostomes
      (jawless fishes), the chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes), the
      teleostomes (bony fishes), and the tetrapods. The cyclostomes Observe the

      cyclostomes include two classes of living, jawless fishes
      (agnathous)—Petromyzontiformes (lamprey eels) and Myxiniformes
      (hagfishes). The hagfishes are totally marine, often living in deep waters
      associated with muddy bottoms.</article></section>

      <section><article> The lampreys may be marine as adults but
      spawn in fresh waters, where the larvae spend some time before
      metamorphosing to the adult. Some lampreys live entirely in fresh water
      and may change only slightly in habit as a result of metamorphosis.
      Without lateral fins, lampreys swim by undulations of the body and can
      control direction only for short distances. lamprey lamprey Lamprey

      The living agnaths are predatory, the lampreys being well known for
      attacking salmonoid fishes. The lamprey attaches to its prey using its
      round, suctorial mouth, and it rasps a hole through the outer tissues
      using a tongue armed with keratinized teeth. It suctions off bits of
      tissue, blood, and body fluids. The hagfishes feed somewhat similarly, but
      on a variety of prey—invertebrates (worms and soft-bodied forms) and dead
      fishes. The lampreys produce small eggs, which develop directly into
      larvae that burrow into the muddy bottom of the stream. With its mouth at
      the surface of the mud, the larva filter feeds until large enough to
      metamorphose and swim off as a small adult. In contrast, the hagfishes
      produce relatively large encapsulated, yolky eggs up to two centimetres in
      length. When laid, these eggs attach to any available object by terminal
      hooks. The encased egg develops more or less directly into a miniature
      adult. The chondrichthyes The sharks, rays, and chimaerids are usually
      marine, but some sharks have entered fresh waters (the Amazon) or even
      live there permanently (Lake Nicaragua).</section></article>

      <section> <article>In size, sharks range from the
      whale shark, nearly 10 metres in length, to rather small species, three
      centimetres in length. They usually weigh 25 to 200 kilograms (55 to 440
      pounds). Sharks are predatory animals. Some large shark species (basking
      and whale sharks) filter feed on small crustaceans. Herbivorous sharks are
      unknown. Sharks swim by undulations of the tail, but rays “fly” through
      the water by undulations of the pectoral fins. Most species occur in
      near-shore waters, but some range widely throughout the oceans. A few are
      found in deep water. southern stingray (Dasyatis americana or Hypanus

      Bob Abrams—Bruce Coleman Inc. A few sharks produce live young (viviparous)
      after internal fertilization. The posterior angle of the male’s pelvic
      fins are modified into a clasper, which acts as an intromittent organ in
      copulating with the female. Most sharks lay large yolky, encapsulated eggs
      with hooks for attachment. The young develop directly and begin life as
      miniature adults. The young that develop in the mother’s uterus obtain
      nutrients from the large yolk sac until they are born alive. In a few
      cases, the uterine wall secretes nutrients. The teleostome, or
      osteichthyian, fishes (those having an internal bony skeleton) can be
      divided into two groups: the subclasses Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes)
      and Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes).</article></section>
      <br>
      <section><article> The latter group includes the
      lungfishes, which live in marshes, ponds, or streams, and are frequent air
      breathers. They lay fairly large eggs, with a limited amount of yolk, that
      are enclosed in jelly coats like those of an amphibian. The eggs develop
      into small fishes that feed on live prey. The larvae of the African
      lungfish have external gills to supplement oxygen intake. The teleostomes
      Actinopterygian fishes are the common bony fishes of modern aquatic
      environments. They range in size from fishes that are only millimetres in
      size to those two or more metres (6.6 or more feet) in length, weighing
      500 kilograms or more. Large species (sturgeons) are found in fresh waters
      (several other large species are found in the Amazon) as well as in marine
      environments. The diet may include plants, animals, and carrion. Most
      species are midwater swimmers, but many spend much time lying on the
      bottom. Tail, pectoral, and even dorsal fins are used in swimming.
      Reproduction in this group is by way of large numbers of small eggs, which
      produce small larvae or develop directly to the adult. American paddlefish

      Bob Evans/Peter Arnold, Inc. The tetrapods The tetrapods live primarily on
      land and are rather similar in habit. Members include the amphibians,
      reptiles, birds, and mammals. Amphibians are widespread in the warmer
      parts of the continents, being absent only in the far north and in the
      Antarctic. Three orders are recognized: Candata (the salamanders), the
      frogs and toads (Anura, or Salientia), and the Apoda or Gymnophiona
      (caecilians). Modification takes many forms, from the moist glandular skin
      (some scale remnants persist in apodans) to the loss of many of the bones
      of the skull. Like their ancestors, amphibians are cold-blooded and tend
      to be aquatic or limited to moist surroundings. Salamanders are seemingly
      the least modified in body form. They do not actively pursue prey and at
      best are only marginal swimmers. In swimming or crawling, the salamander’s
      body and tail undulate. Frogs and toads hop using hind-limb propulsion and
      the forelimbs as body props. This dominance of the hind limb in locomotion
      is best seen in swimming when the forelimbs are drawn back against the
      body. In contrast to the salamanders and frogs, the burrowing, wormlike
      apodans are without limbs.</article></section>

      canadensis) are 35–43 inches (90–110 cm) long, with a red crown, a bluish
      or brownish gray body tinged with sandy yellow, and a long, harsh,
      penetrating call. © ElementalImaging/iStock.com Amphibians usually trap
      food using a tongue that can be shot out of the mouth, or they use the
      mouth itself to grasp and ingest food. There is great variation in foods;
      only the larvae of frogs and toads appear to be plant feeders, a
      specialization that is reflected in the highly modified jaws and guts of
      the tadpoles. Amphibians have retained a simple egg cell with a gelatinous
      cover. The eggs are laid in ponds, streams, or even in damp places high in
      trees, usually in great numbers. Fertilized eggs develop into
      free-swimming larvae, which then metamorphose to adults, but in highly
      specialized forms. The class Reptilia retains many of the structural
      characteristics of the ancestral amphibian. While most reptiles are
      carnivorous, feeding on other organisms, a few are herbivorous (e.g.,
      tortoises). As cold-blooded animals, reptiles tend to be limited to
      temperate and tropical areas, but, where found, they are relatively
      common, although not as large or conspicuous as birds or mammals. Most
      reptiles are terrestrial, but a few are aquatic. As basic tetrapods,
      reptiles move about by creeping or swimming in a fashion similar to
      amphibians. Some reptiles, however, can lift the body from the ground and
      run rapidly either in a quadrupedal or bipedal fashion. Reptiles lay
      relatively large, shelled eggs. In a few instances, the eggs and young are
      cared for by the female; in others, the young are born alive
      (ovovivipary). Birds are warm-blooded, and, although most are capable of
      flight, others are sedentary and some are flightless. Like their relatives
      the reptiles, birds lay shelled eggs that differ largely in the amount of
      calcification (hardening) of the shell. The young are usually cared for in
      a nest until they are capable of flight and self-feeding, but some birds
      hatch in a well-developed state that allows them to begin feeding
      immediately or even take flight. The megapods lay their eggs in mounds of
      rotting vegetation, which supplies the heat for incubation.</article> </section>

      <section><article>
    (Nesting activities similar to those of some birds are seen in the crocodilians.)
      The mammals range in size from tiny shrews or small bats weighing only a
      few grams to the largest known animals, the whales. Most mammals are
      terrestrial, feeding on both animal and vegetable matter, but a few are
      partially aquatic or entirely so, as in the case of the whales or
      porpoises. Mammals move about in a great variety of ways: burrowing,
      bipedal or tetrapedal running, flying, or swimming. Reproduction in
      mammals is usually viviparous, the young developing in the uterus, where
      nutritive materials are made available through an allantoic placenta or,
      in a few cases, a yolk sac. The fertilized egg develops directly into the
      adult. The monotremes (platypus and echidna) differ from other mammals in
      that they lay eggs which hatch, and the relatively undeveloped young are
      carried in a pouch or kept in a nest; the growing young lap up a milk
      nutrient fluid exuded from the belly of the mother. Form and function
      External features The evolution of the notochord, dorsal nerve tube, and
      pharyngeal slits in chordate structure suggests improved swimming
      capability and probably greater ability to capture prey. Specialization in
      the vertebrate for the active capture of larger prey is evident both in
      the structure of the mouth and in the relatively simple structure of the
      pharynx, with its strong gill development. Specialization for feeding is
      again seen in the two basic groups of vertebrates, the agnathans and
      gnathostomes. Swimming adaptations are also numerous and involve
      variations both in body form and in medial fins and the two pairs of
      lateral fins. Internal features The skeletal system Support and protection
      are provided by the exoskeletal and endoskeletal divisions of the skeletal
      system. The exoskeleton, when present, is basically protective but
      functions in tooth support in the mouth region. The endoskeleton protects
      the brain and spinal cord and assists primarily with locomotion in the
      trunk and tail regions. The endoskeleton begins as cartilage and may
      remain so or may develop into bone. The cartilaginous endoskeleton, found
      in the shark or chimaerid, is usually calcified so as to be stiffer and
      stronger. Bone is distinctive but highly variable; some types of bone
      contain cells, others do not, or the bone may be laminar, spongy, or
      arranged in sheathing layers around blood channels. Tissues and muscles
      Tissue development in the vertebrate is unique in its complexity; tissues
      in the strict sense (defined as a mass or sheet of similar cells with a
      similar function), however, do not exist. The simplest situation is seen
      in the epidermis, but even here there is a layered system in which
      different cell types provide different functions (such as protection and
      secretion). The stratified epithelium of the vertebrate is highly
      characteristic of that group (a similar one is seen in only one
      invertebrate group, the class Chaetognatha). Other tissues of the
      vertebrate are more complex than the epithelium. For example, skeletal
      muscle consists not only of striated muscle fibres but also of connective
      tissue, which binds it together and attaches it by way of tendons. This
      contractible tissue includes nerves and blood vessels and their contained
      blood. Skeletal muscles thus appear as simple organs, just as do the
      smooth muscles in the wall of the gut or the iris muscles of the eye. Such
      unique histological complexity runs through the entire body of the
      vertebrate.</article></section><br>
