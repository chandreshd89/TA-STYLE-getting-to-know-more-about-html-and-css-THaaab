        <h2>All About Amphibians</h2>
      <p>
        All amphibians are vertebrates, and they need moist environments or
        water to survive. They are cold-blooded. They absorb water and breathe
        through their thin skin. They have at least one special skin gland used
        for defense. Most follow the life cycle of egg-larva-adul

      <p>
        You can find examples of amphibians all around the world. In some cases,
        examples of amphibians seem like the same animals, but they can be quite
        different like a frog and a toad.
